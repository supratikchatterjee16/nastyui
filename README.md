# NASTY UI

This project gives a simple demonstration of one of three use cases for people to make use of the [NASTY](https://github.com/supratikchatterjee16/NASTY) project.

It shows relations between entities, to give a view of Relational Analysis. This can be made use of in multiple ways, for finding logical relations and relationally distant entities.

## Installing

Simply perform a git pull on this repository or download and extract in a folder. This works after having executed the entirety of the NASTY at least once. So, kindly do not start it up and judge it as a failed project.

## Execution

Executing the program is fairly simple. Just fire up the python program with python3 as follows :

```shell
python3 serve.py
```
